# drexeltwo

A new social media platform for Drexel students.

## What is DrexelTwo?

This project aims to connect students of Drexel University with each other, through methods such as sharing jokes and information about the happenings on campus.


##Organization

All the backend code is housed within main.py. We are using the Flask framework to handle the backend functionality, as well as Firebase as our database. Our frontend HTML and CSS is contained within the static and templates folders.
